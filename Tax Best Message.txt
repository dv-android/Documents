 On a bank deposit of ₹2000/- for one year, what U get is ₹160/- @ 8%

On a bank loan of ₹2000/- for one year, what U pay is ₹260/- @ 13% 

But when U eat food for same ₹2000/- U pay ₹360/- @ 18% to Govt!!

This is really nice!
Just to remind.. How much W pay for buying an item worth ₹1000.

Assume that I need to buy an item of base price of ₹1000.
Assume it attracts GST @18% 
I will need to pay ₹1000 + ₹180 = ₹1180 for that item.

Now, I need to earn ₹1180 first, to be able to pay this amount.

Assume that I am in the 20% Income Tax bracket (income between ₹5 Lakhs - ₹10 Lakhs per year).

If I earn ₹1486.15, then I will have to pay Income Tax of ₹297.23 (@20%) + Cess of ₹8.92 (@3% of the IT) & that will leave me with an earning (after IT) of  ₹1180.

Hence, to buy an item of base price ₹1000, I need to earn ₹1486.15.

Which means that I pay ₹486.15 in taxes on the purchase of an item of ₹1000.

And that, dolts, implies a tax of over 48.6% paid overall (through both direct + indirect taxes).

Now, this figure will be far higher for items in the 28% GST slab. (It will be 61.2% in total taxes)!!!
